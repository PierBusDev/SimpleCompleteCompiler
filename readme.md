# Project Overview

This project is about building the various block of a very simple compiler starting from the basis (DFA, Lexers) and proceeding towards more advanced constructs (Parsers, Translators, CodeGenerators) using what was created previously.

In the code there are both stand-alone exercises and parts used in the next sessions.

Except for the suggestion about the basic skeleton of the application (given by the professors of the course "Linguaggi formali e traduttori" (*formal languages and translators*) of UniTO) the whole code is written by me.
